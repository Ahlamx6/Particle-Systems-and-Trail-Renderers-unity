# Particle-Systems-and-Trail-Renderers-unity
Simple example to create a projectile that simulates an explosion using a Trail Renderer and a Particle System.

- Create and design a sphere that leaves a Trailer Renderer behind and explodes into a Particle System after a few seconds of existing.

- Sphere must bounce off surfaces using a Physic Material.

- Sphere must be launched using Rigidbody.AddForce.
